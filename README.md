# Gallery House

Beauty is in the eye of beholder, but composition is a science. Let us help you build the perfect gallery wall for your home, informed by color theory and principles of shape. 

Developer team GAMK (Grace, Alex, Malinda, and Katrina) are proud to introduce Gallery House: an eye-catching application that makes curating the art on your wall not just easy, but fun!

Powered by Etsyâ€™s public API (v3), upload an image of your art to your Gallery Wall, and Gallery House shows you pieces that compliment it based color, sourced from one of our six featured Esty sellers. Click on a piece of art and navigate to its Esty listing, or save your Gallery Wall and come back to view it later.

<!-- ## Start

Sync and seed your database by running `npm run seed`. Running `npm run start:dev` will make great things happen!

- start:dev will both start your server and build your client side files using webpack
- start:dev:logger is the same as start:dev, but you will see your SQL queries (can be helpful for debugging)
- start:dev:seed will start your server and also seed your database (this is useful when you are making schema changes and you don't want to run your seed script separately) -->
