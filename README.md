# Gallery House

Beauty is in the eye of beholder, but composition is a science. Let us help you build the perfect gallery wall for your home, informed by color theory and principles of shape. 

Developer team GAMK (Grace, Alex, Malinda, and Katrina) are proud to introduce Gallery House: an eye-catching application that makes curating the art on your wall not just easy, but fun!

Powered by Etsyâ€™s public API (v3), upload an image of your art to your Gallery Wall, and Gallery House shows you pieces that compliment it based color, sourced from one of our six featured Esty sellers. Click on a piece of art and navigate to its Esty listing, or save your Gallery Wall and come back to view it later.
